Project can be done with any language and framework you want

The project will be a simple todo application with the 
familiar features of create, read, update, and delete (CRUD). 

We'll develop it during all parts of this course. Check the title of the exercise for 
"Project vX.Y" to know it is about building the project.

Todo is a text like "I need to clean the house" that can be in state of not-done or done.
